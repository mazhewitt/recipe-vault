## 1. Total Time Derivation

- [x] 1.1 Add a client-side helper to compute total time from prep/cook or step durations in [static/app.js](static/app.js)
- [x] 1.2 Ensure the helper returns no value when timing data is missing or zero

## 2. UI Metadata Rendering

- [x] 2.1 Extend the recipe metadata render to include total time when available
- [x] 2.2 Add or reuse an icon style for total time and update layout spacing if needed

## 3. Validation

- [x] 3.1 Verify total time appears for recipes with prep/cook times
- [x] 3.2 Verify total time appears for recipes with step durations only
- [x] 3.3 Verify total time is omitted when no timing data exists
