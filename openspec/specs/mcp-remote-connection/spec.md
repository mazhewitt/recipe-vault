# MCP Remote Connection Specification

## Purpose

The MCP Remote Connection capability defines the requirements and configuration for connecting a local Claude Desktop application to a remote Recipe Vault instance (e.g., on a Synology NAS) over the local network.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Remote MCP Connectivity
The Standalone MCP server SHALL support connecting to a Recipe Vault API instance over the local network.

#### Scenario: Configure MCP with remote IP
- **WHEN** the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable is set to `http://192.168.1.9:3000`
- **AND** the Standalone MCP server is started
- **THEN** it successfully communicates with the API server at that address
- **AND** MCP tools function using the remote data

### Requirement: Cross-Device Authentication
The MCP server SHALL authenticate successfully with a remote Recipe Vault instance using a valid API key.

#### Scenario: Authenticate with remote API key
- **WHEN** the `API_KEY` environment variable is set to the key generated by the remote NAS instance
- **AND** a tool call is made via Claude Desktop
- **THEN** the remote API server accepts the request
- **AND** the tool execution completes successfully

### Requirement: Configuration Documentation
The system SHALL provide documentation for configuring Claude Desktop to connect to a remote instance.

#### Scenario: Documentation presence
- **WHEN** the project documentation is reviewed
- **THEN** it includes instructions for updating `claude_desktop_config.json` with remote settings
- **AND** it specifies the required environment variables (`API_BASE_URL`, `API_KEY`)
